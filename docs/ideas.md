# The List of Possible Ideas
- So what can you do with all this money? You can hire an army and take over a fictional land! It goes Wesnoth style, where you send different groups to different areas and have a limited radius you can view. Of course status updates are sent to the DMs. You start out randomly somewhere, then if you're in an occupied area, you can launch a rebellion. There's also resourceful towns, key points, and terrain differences and such.
	- Updates every few minutes throughout the day (if it's 24/7 running), so there's no feasible way you can stay on all the time, so there's a risk factor involved. (Also with the stock market, updating every 15 minute interval.)
	- Also, for each map, there are a finite amount of resources. And that's it. That's all there'll ever be for that map.
	- There'll be both worlds to take over with small benefits. You have to have a certain threshold of power in a region to be able to spawn there, and once you spawn somewhere, you're stuck there until you lose or set your base of operations somewhere else. You can setup armies and send them off into the distance. You can check in the field of vision of your armies, so it'll allow for surprise attacks. If you're in an area that's already claimed but want to start there, you can also instigate a rebellion.
- Also, a music bot that loops perfectly? Scratch that, it just doesn't work. But maybe have user playlists and such that can shuffle together in unison, so everyone gets their turn. I haven't seen that before. Either add to the current (temporary) playlist or draw from a user-defined playlist.
	- My bot when playing music will have people cast a vote on whether to skip. People can skip their own songs, and of course admins can do both.
	- Also, try WebAudio for looping again?
	- $admin emoji currency credit (set the currency emoji to :credit:)
- Users can also define their own alises. CrossExchange won't just be limited to stonks, I plan to extend it to be multi-purpose. IE playlists and such.
- (Organizational) Maybe add a `templates` key in `init.json` to initialize stuff like the user object in storage?
- Currency uses: emojis from another server, access to certain channels/commands, a cost on certain commands (like `get`), etc. (all temporary). Maybe a gladiator arena of some sort too?

# Command Ideas
- `$copypasta`: Paste a text file of a script like those copypastas or game text dumps.
- `$playlist`: Add/remove to your playlist which determines which song is played when the music is turned on.
- `$search <channel> <regex pattern (allowing for emotes)>`
