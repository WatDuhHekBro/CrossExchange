- JSON data will be cached in order to increase efficiency, so if you make manual changes to those data files, use `$admin reload cache`.
- For the stock market feature, you have to declare which channel will host the scoreboards displaying the market values, which'll be edited afterwards. Don't delete any messages unless you're resetting it. I did this to avoid spam.
