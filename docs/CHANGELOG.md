# 1.0.1
- Removed the market catalog feature. This was due to catastrophic results when simulating the market for 50 days. There was an out of memory error when loading in the data.
- Made message intercept false by default. I think it's better to make it more of a voluntary action.

# 1.0.0
Implemented the core features of the bot.
