# User Guide
This isn't a comprehensive guide to all the commands as that's already embedded in the `help` command.
- To begin the stonks and initialize its news into a server, you have to dedicate a channel to it. This will be the channel the bot updates whenever stuff changes. `$admin init` which can be used by server admins and the bot's mechanics.
- You can get credits every 22 hours by doing `$money get`. Then do `$stonks` to buy and sell le stonks.
