A Discord bot game where you can trade stonks to generate profit. The more profit you have, the more influence you have in the government ruled by the bot, and it spews forth random policies/laws which can be voted on by everyone in the server. These policies are generated from a list, some examples are "You are not allowed to say _____ or else you will be jailed for 5 minutes.", and an opposite effect repealing an existing law. Stonks are not random themselves, but the individual companies that make up macrotrends are. And of course, there'll be a constitution that anyone can read which shows the list of all laws, repealed or not. Or maybe have users propose laws based on a template like the above.

But of course, if I crown myself as the Supreme Leader, I can overrule anything and any law must go through me.
