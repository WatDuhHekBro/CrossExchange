Discord Bot: A real time tactical game where you log in and out and issue commands while you're there. Minimal investment, just a dumb thing to play around with.
CrossStonks/CrossExchange if it's CC related.
- Basin Stonks
- Helnovien Stonks
Yes, it takes Velsarbor markets too. And any OC markets too, like the Arcane Lab.
News and other events affect stonks, so keep up with that. IE, "A sharp demand for iron has made Helnovien stonks rise by 33% in value!" or "Bad weather has made travel to Basin Keep much more difficult, making its stonks plummet."
- A sudden riot in Helnovien has decreased production by 55%, making its stocks plummet.
- Baki'kum is experiencing a heavy drought, making its stock decrease in value.
Different stonks have different lucrativity and stability levels, the both obviously being negative of each other. For example, Helnovien can be an extremely lucrative stonk to invest in, but is also extremely volatile.
